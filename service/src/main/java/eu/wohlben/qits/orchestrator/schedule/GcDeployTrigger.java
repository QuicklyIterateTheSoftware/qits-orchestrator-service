/**
 * The gc run's second unattended trigger: <b>a deployment went live</b>.
 *
 * <p>The cron beside this class is a clock, and a clock is a guess about when there is something to
 * collect. A deployment is the fact itself — it is the moment the image the predecessor container
 * ran, and every registry identity the release it carried superseded, stop being referenced by
 * anything. Until this existed those bytes sat on the platform's disk until 03:00 the next day for
 * no reason but the schedule. {@code bus/DeploymentActiveListener} is the ear; this is the policy.
 *
 * <h2>Trailing edge, and why not leading</h2>
 *
 * <p>A platform release rolls several applications within a few minutes, so the events arrive as a
 * WAVE. Each new one <b>pushes the pending run back</b> to {@code quiet-period} from now, so the
 * wave collapses into exactly ONE run that fires after the last event — and that run then drains
 * what the whole wave superseded, registry identities and host images together, in a single pass.
 *
 * <p>Firing on the leading edge would do the opposite of what is wanted: the run would plan against
 * a platform still being deployed, the seven deployments behind it would each be refused as
 * already-active, and the bytes the last of them freed would wait for the cron anyway.
 *
 * <h2>What it will not do</h2>
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Never a dry run.</b> A dry run is a measurement somebody asked for; this trigger exists
 *       to reclaim, and a debounced dry run would be a nightly report nobody reads.
 *   <li><b>Never past a gate.</b> {@code gc.enabled} and {@code deploy-trigger.enabled} are both
 *       read, and both are read AGAIN when the quiet period lapses rather than only when the wave
 *       started — the run is the thing being gated, not the timer.
 *   <li><b>Never a second concurrent run.</b> {@code RunStore.open} refuses one inside the opening
 *       transaction, which is the platform's real single-flight rule and the reason this class does
 *       not keep a flag of its own. A refusal is the ordinary case for a long run and not a fault,
 *       so it is a DEBUG — and the wave is <b>re-armed</b> for another quiet period, because the
 *       events that caused it were about identities the running run may already have planned
 *       around.
 *   <li><b>Never throw at the caller.</b> {@link #onDeploymentActive} runs on the bus's claim
 *       thread, inside the transaction that claims the event; a throw there rolls the claim back
 *       and the event is owed forever. Everything here is memory and a schedule, and the run itself
 *       starts on the timer's thread, well outside that transaction.
 * </ul>
