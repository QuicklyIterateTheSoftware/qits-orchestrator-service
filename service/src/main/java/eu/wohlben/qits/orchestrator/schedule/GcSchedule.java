/**
 * The clock — one of the gc run's two unattended triggers, and the BACKSTOP of the pair.
 *
 * <p>{@link GcDeployTrigger} beside it is the other, and it is the one with a reason: a deployment
 * going live is the moment what it superseded stops being referenced, while a clock is only a guess
 * about when that has happened. This schedule stays unchanged for what the guess still catches — a
 * day with no deployment at all, a wave the trigger was down for, and everything that ages out
 * without anything being deployed.
 *
 * <p><b>Two gates, and they say different things.</b> {@code qits.orchestrator.gc.enabled} is
 * whether the clock may start a run at all; {@code qits.orchestrator.gc.dry-run} is whether the run
 * it starts may delete. A platform that wants to watch the figures for a week sets the second and
 * reads the runs in the UI — a dry run still calls every peer and reports real numbers, so it is a
 * measurement rather than a no-op. Neither key touches a MANUAL run: a person choosing Run now is
 * the decision.
 *
 * <p><b>{@code SKIP} on a concurrent execution</b>, the mirror's shape, and the store's active-run
 * check behind it. A run that outlives its own schedule is never joined by a second one — one of
 * the two guards would be enough, and both are here because they fail differently: SKIP costs
 * nothing and leaves no row, while the store's check is what also covers a person and the cron
 * arriving together.
